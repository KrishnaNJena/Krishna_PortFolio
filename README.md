# Project 1: [Wafer Fault Detection](https://github.com/KrishnaNJena/Wafer-Fault-Detection)

#### Overview:

* Created an app to classify the quality of a Wafer based on available on training data.
* Scrapped over more than 10K records from the client w.r.t Data Sharing Agreement.  
* Prediction output i.e. -1: Fault Wafer & +1 Good Wafer. 
* Optimized different Machine Learning Algorithms like- Random Forest & XGBOOST using Randomized Search CV to reach the best model. 
* Built a Client facing API using Flask. 



# Project 2: [Phising Classifiers](https://github.com/KrishnaNJena/Phising-Classifiers) 

#### Overview:

* Created an app to classify the Websites whether its Phising or not based on given set of Predictors.
* Scrapped over more than 15K records from the Client w.r.t Data Sharing Agreement.
* Prediction Output i.e. -1: Valid Website & +1 Invalid Website.
* Optimized different Machine Learning Algorithms like- Random Forest, Support Vector Macgine & XGBoost using Randomized Search CV to reach the best model.
* Built a client facing API using Flask.

# Project 3: [Shredder Machine Detection](https://github.com/KrishnaNJena/S-M-Detection)

#### Overview:

* Aim is to detect the Hand when we provide Garbage to Shredder Machine & make me notify by raising alarm or stopping the Machine further avoidance any fault with employee.
* Build a CV Model provide a solution to achieve more MAP & FPS.

# Project 4: [Automatic Number Plate Recognition](https://github.com/KrishnaNJena/ANPR-Detection)

#### Overview:

* Project is to detect the Number Plate of the Veichle in Parking System / Hub / Traffic Signal & produce a challan or letter further violating any rules.
* Build a CV Model & automating data extraction from captured image file used OCR Techniques.


# Project 5: [Brand Measure](https://github.com/KrishnaNJena/Brand-Measure)

#### Overview: 

* Before Launching a new product Customer must have a knowledge on its type & quality.
* Aim is to to know the Sentiment or Review of the Product w.r.t the Telephonic Conversation with our 1000 customers using Natural Language Processing.
* Built a Client Facing app using Flask.
