# Project 1: [Wafer Fault Detection](https://github.com/KrishnaNJena/Wafer-Fault-Detection)

#### Overview:

* Created an app to classify the quality of a Wafer based on available on training data.
* Scrapped over more than 10K records from the client w.r.t Schema.json File.  
* Analyzed EDA before creating a Custom Pipeline, File & Data Validation based on master data & source of truth.
* Prediction output i.e. -1: Fault Wafer & +1 Good Wafer. 
* Optimized different Machine Learning Algorithms like- Random Forest & XGBOOST using Randomized Search CV to reach the best model with accuracy of 90.4. 
* Built a Client facing API using Flask. 



# Project 2: [Phising Classifiers](https://github.com/KrishnaNJena/Phising-Classifiers) 

#### Overview:

* Created an app to classify the Websites whether its Phising or not based on given set of Predictors.
* Scrapped over more than 15K records from the Client w.r.t Data Sharing Agreement.
* Prediction Output i.e. -1: Valid Website & +1 Invalid Website.
* Prepared Custom Pipeline, File & Data Validation based on master data & source of truth.
* Optimized different Machine Learning Algorithms like- Random Forest, Support Vector Macgine & XGBoost using Randomized Search CV to reach the best model.
* Improved accuracy of 93.4 % on applied ML algorithm based on cluster of the dataset
* Built a client facing API using Flask.

# Project 3: [Shredder Machine Detection](https://github.com/KrishnaNJena/S-M-Detection)

#### Overview:

* Aim is to detect the Hand when we provide Garbage to Shredder Machine & make me notify by raising alarm or stopping the Machine further avoidance any fault with employee.
* Achieved 59 FPS with MAP 76.9 % with 1000 label image using SSD Model in Google Colab NVIDIA GPU P100.
